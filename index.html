                <span id = "info">Hey, I'm a student living in a beautiful island called
                Sri Lanka located in the Indian Ocean.It is nicknamed Pearl of the Indian Ocean and teardrop of India.
                Our country is the best destination for a tea lover.
                Sri Lanka may not be the best in the point 
                of development but is far better than other countries in South Asia.                                              
                I'm a student of CIS (Colombo International School) and currently pursuing my A/L (after my O/L got 
                cancelled due to the pandemic) while anxiously waiting for my predicitve O/L results expected in August.
                However thinking positively, I was able to take this time from quarantine to expand my knowledge on the 
                topic that I am very fond of - coding. I had gone through several websites to learn the hottest topic
                in the internet - web development and gained a decent amount of knowledge in HTML, Javascript, Python
                and many more languages.
